UPS-18650-Lite是一款专门为树莓派B型系列主板（既4B/3B+/3B等，以下简称pi）所设计的UPS电源，采用两节标准的平头18650锂电池进行供电，支持过充、过放、过流、短路保护，支持外部电源插入检测，支持边充边放，既插上外部电源时，pi由外部电源供电，拔掉外部电源时，pi无缝切换为锂电池供电。UPS-18650-Lite通过7根弹性顶针与pi主板连接，pi的供电以及电量读取功能都是通过顶针来完成， pi不需要再插任何电源线，只要把外部电源线插在UPS的type-c口即可完成供电和充电。另外UPS-18650-Lite集成了专业电量计芯片MAX17040G，可用于对UPS电池电压及电池剩余电量进行测量。

UPS-18650-Lite is a UPS power supply specially designed for Raspberry Pi model B series boards (namely 4B/3B+/3B, etc., hereinafter referred to as pi). It uses two standard flat-head 18650 lithium batteries for power supply. It support  over-charge, over-discharge, over-current, short-circuit protection, support external power plug-in detection, support charging and discharging, when the external power is plugged in, the pi is powered by the external power source, when the external power source is unplugged, the pi seamlessly switches to the lithium battery power supply . UPS-18650-Lite is connected to the pi through 7 pogopins. The power supply and battery power measurement functions of the pi are all done through pogopins. The pi does not need to plug any power cords, just plug the external power cord into the UPS type-C port ,it can complete power supply and charging by the UPS. In addition, UPS-18650-Lite integrates the professional fuel gauge chip MAX17040G, which can be used to measure UPS battery voltage and battery remaining power.
